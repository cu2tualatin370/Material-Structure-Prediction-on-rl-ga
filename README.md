# Material-Structure-Prediction-on-rl-ga
this project focus on Material-Structure-Prediction based on rl ga maybe there will be AI GC in the future
change some constant in the file constant: 
  the project now use SiO2 as sample if you want to change it to your chemistry .
  please edit constant.formula_list and constant.num_atoms.
process of the project:
  the project only finish the code of generate the initial population until now.
  there is no ga and rl but I believe there will be them soon.
how to use it:
  first you you should check the requirements.txt to confirm your cuda version.
  my cuda version is 126 if your cuda is not this version. 
  change the version is the file to the right version. 
  then run the file setup_win.ps1 in powershell.
other things:
although I have not check if the file setup_win.ps1 can run
but I confirm that my code have no fault
if you fail check your nvidia drivers version and other things
