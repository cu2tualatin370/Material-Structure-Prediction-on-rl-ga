# Material-Structure-Prediction-on-rl-ga
this project focus on Material-Structure-Prediction based on rl ga maybe there will be AI GC in the future
change some constant in the file constant: 
  the project now use SiO2 as sample if you want to change it to your chemistry .
  please edit constant.formula_list and constant.num_atoms.
process of the project:
  the project only finish the code of generate the initial population until now.
  there is no ga and rl but I believe there will be them soon.
how to use it:
